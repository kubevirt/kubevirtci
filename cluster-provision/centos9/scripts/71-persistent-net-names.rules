# Persistent network interface naming based on MAC address
# This ensures that the primary interface gets eth0 regardless of enumeration order
#
# Primary interface (MAC pattern 52:55:00:d1:55:*) -> eth0
# Secondary interfaces will automatically get eth1, eth2, etc. through normal enumeration

# Match primary interface by MAC address pattern (supports wildcard)
