# section: regex
# notes:
#   regex is always recursive, will create a specific rule for each folder
#     example: cluster-provision/k8s/[0-9].[0-9][0-9]*
#     only last dir can be a regex
#     must contain at least one /
#   regex_none will expand the list and assign rule none
#     key should be a directory ending with /*
#     i.e cluster-up/cluster/kind*
